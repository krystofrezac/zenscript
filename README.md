# ZenScript 

Strictly typed, minimalistic language compiled to JS.

## What I want it to have
- as few syntactical sugar as possible - syntax should be consistent(ideally everything will be just function calls, with few exceptions)
- type system that doesn't require any explicit types from user
- pipe operator
- easy to understand error messages
- interop with JS - but strict, not like TS where you just believe that something has certain type
- relative imports so you can have highly nested files
- built-in formatter
- built-in testing framework 
- macros

## What I don't want it to have
- exceptions
- null/undefined
- global built-in variables
